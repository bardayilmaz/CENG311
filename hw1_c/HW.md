# HOMEWORK 1

In this homework you are supposed to write a C program in which you can create a simple song
list. You must use given data structures and implement given methods properly. The user of the
program must be able to

● add a song to the list by providing its name and duration

● delete a song from the list by providing its name

● list all songs

## Notes:

● The elements field of dynamic_array is a pointer that stores the address of elements
rather than elements as values. You can regard elements as an array of void*.
